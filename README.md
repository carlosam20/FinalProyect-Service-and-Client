# FinalProyect-Service-and-Client
This proyect was made in my class of service and client development, I didn´t end the part of the views that involved css because I choose to do extra services

The proyect consist in a web shopping site, that can track the shipping of the bought items.
It has an admin part that is divided from the client and server part. Also in this proyect I used the MVC model to divide the diferent functions of It.
Another thing important is that I used Spring and Java to develop It and mustache and JavaScript for the client part, at that time I didn´t know how to use Angular.
